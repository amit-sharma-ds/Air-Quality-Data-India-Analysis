Air Quality Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes air quality data by performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling. Various regression and classification models were implemented to predict AQI (Air Quality Index) based on pollutant levels.

📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains air pollution data with the following key columns:

state & location: Region where the air quality was measured.

so2, no2, rspm, spm, pm2_5: Different air pollutants affecting AQI.

SI, NI, RPI, SPI, AQI: Calculated indices for air pollution impact.

sampling_date: Date of sample collection (used in time series analysis).

🛠 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Visualization Tools: Power BI

🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Handled missing values using mean, median, mode, fillna, and dropna.

Performed summary statistics, correlation analysis, and data visualization.

Created heatmaps, boxplots, and scatter plots to understand pollutant trends.

📊 Machine Learning Models
1️⃣ Regression Models
Linear Regression (LR) → RMSE: 46.52 | R²: 0.85

Decision Tree (DT) → RMSE: 1.09 | R²: 0.99

Random Forest (RF) → RMSE: 1.02 | R²: 0.99 ✅ (Best)

2️⃣ Classification Models
Logistic Regression → Accuracy: 39.1% | Kappa Score: 0.20

Decision Tree (DT) → Accuracy: 99.99% | Kappa Score: 0.99 ✅ (Best)

Random Forest (RF) → Accuracy: 99.98% | Kappa Score: 0.99 ✅

KNN → Accuracy: 99.14% | Kappa Score: 0.98

🏆 Conclusion
Random Forest (RF) performed the best in both regression & classification.

Time series analysis (ARIMA, SARIMA) can be explored for future AQI forecasting.

Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards for better insights.
